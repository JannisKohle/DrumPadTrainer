# Drum-Pad-Trainer

A program that help you get better at drumming by practicing different Exercises at different BPM. To use the App, you need npm installed because the desktop app is created with Electron.

## What it does:

You can create Exercises that you can store in a DB. If you store them, they will be public - everybody can see them, of course only if they know the exercise's name or ID. If you don't want other people to see your exercises and you're only using it on one device, you don't have to do that.
